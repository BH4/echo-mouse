# echo-mouse
Record a sequence of mouse inputs (an echo) and play them back as needed. Echos can be played back faster or slower and the number of times the echo occurs can also be set to a finite number or set to infinitely repeat. Additionally, recorded inputs and settings can be saved to an "echo" file and loaded back in. While replaying inputs the mouse can be moved in any way to end it, easily preventing any unwanted clicks or to stop an infinite echo.

## Warnings
When starting the recording the provided button can be used or the F5 shortcut but you must use the F5 shortcut to end the recording as clicking on the button a second time to end the recording will end up as part of the recording and subsequently be replayed.
